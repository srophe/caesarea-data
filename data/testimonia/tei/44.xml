         <desc type="context">Cornelius Tacitus (ca. 56-ca. 120 C.E.) was an ancient historian of
            the Roman Empire held in high esteem by scholars today. He enjoyed a successful career
            as a prominent lawyer, a rising official in both the civic and provincial spheres, and
            eventually suffect consul in 97 C.E. and then governor of Asia in 112-113 C.E. His major
            historical works, <title>Histories</title> and so-called <title>Annals</title> (“From
            the Departure of Augustus the God,” <foreign>ab excessu divi Augusti</foreign>), offered
            a detailed narrative with penetrating political analysis of the Imperial government and
            its ruling class from the death of Augustus through the Flavian dynasty, probably the
            death of Domitian (14-96 C.E.) | This important passage in the Histories recounts the
            pivotal months during early 69 C.E. when Vespasian rose to supreme power in the East. He
            had led Imperial troops against the Jewish Revolt since 66 CE when he joined forces with
            Mucianus, the powerful governor of Syria, and received the famous prophecy of his
            elevation to the throne on Mount Carmel. From there Mucianus advanced north overland
            eventually to challenge the short-lived emperor Vitellius, and Vespasian advanced to
            Caesarea, his military base, to continue solidifying control and suppressing unrest in
            Judaea. In Alexandria on July 1 the Egyptian prefect Tiberius Julius Alexander
            orchestrated Vespasian’s acclamation as emperor among the troops, which was followed a
            few days later by his acclamation in Judaea, perhaps at Caesarea. The formal declaration
            by the Roman Senate did not come until December 20, 69 C.E., following the bloody final
            battle in the streets of Rome between the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian.</desc>

            gathered around (Vespasian), encouraged him, and recounted the prophesies of seers and
            the movements of the stars. Indeed he was not unaffected by such beliefs, as one who
            shortly thereafter, when he had gained supreme power, openly employed a certain
            astrologer named Seleucus as his guide and counselor. Old omens rushed back to his mind.
            Once on his farm a cypress of unusual height suddenly fell over, but on the next day it
            rose again from its remnants and grew healthy, tall and even broader than before. This
            was a favorable omen of great significance, all the haruspices agreed, and it promised
            this highest distinction for Vespasian, who was then still a young man. At first, the
            insignia of a triumph, his consulship, and his victory of Judaea appeared to have
            fulfilled the promise given by the omen; but, after he had gained these honors, he began
            to think that his rule over the Empire was foretold. Between Judaea and Syria is Carmel,
            the name of both a mountain and a god. The god has no image or temple, according to
            ancestral tradition; there is only an altar and worship. When Vespasian was making a
            sacrifice there and contemplating his secret hopes, the priest Basilides, upon
            repeatedly inspecting the internal organs, said to him, “Whatever you are planning,
            Vespasian, whether to build a house or to enlarge your rural holdings or to increase the
            number of your slaves, the god grants you a mighty home, vast territory, a multitude of
            men.” These obscure words were immediately caught up in rumor and soon became widely
            known; there was no more popular topic of discussion. There was even more frequent
            discussion in the presence of Vespasian, for men have more to those filled with hope.
            The two (leaders) departed, each with a clear sense of his purpose, Mucianus to Antioch
            and Vespasian to <placeName>Caesarea</placeName>, the one the capital of Syria and the
            other the capital of Judaea. (79) The transfer of the Empire to Vespasian began at
            Alexandria, where Tiberius Alexander moved quickly to administer the oath of allegiance
            to his troops on July 1. This day was celebrated in later times as the first day of
            Vespasian’s reign, though it was on July 3 that army in Judaea swore the oath before
            Vespasian himself, with such excitement that they did not even wait for his son Titus,
            who was coming back from Syria and served as go-between for Mucianus and his father. The
            whole process was carried out by the enthusiastic initiative of the soldiers, without
            prepared speeches or gathering of the troops.<ab type="source" source="#bib44-2"/>
