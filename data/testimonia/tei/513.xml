         <desc type="context">Zachariah of Mytilene's hagiographic account of the life of the early
            sixth-century anti-Chalcedonian bishop, Severus, patriarch of Antioch, includes brief
            accounts of several other saints. In this testimonium, Zachariah describes a religious
            conversion episode from the late fifth century in which one of Severus' contemporaries,
            Anastasius of Edessa, travels via Caesarea Maritima in a manner which evokes the Apostle
            Peter's vision and journey to Caesarea as described in the New Testament (Acts 10). In
            this way, the author seems to blur together two figures, both of whom are called "the
            great Peter". The first figure is the New Testament Apostle Peter. The second figure is
            Peter the Iberian, a fifth-century miaphysite Christian leader and monastic founder
            whose monastery at Miaouma in Gaza became a spiritual home to Anastasius and other
            saints mentioned by Zachariah of Mytilene. The passage also emphasizes the intellectual
            and social connections between the law schools of Beirut and the anti-Chalcedonian
            (miaphysite) Christian clergy and communities of Caesarea and Gaza in this
            period.</desc>

        <anchor xml:id="testimonia-513.en.1" corresp="#testimonia-513.syr.1"/>When writing the virtues of God-clad men, of Peter from Iberia, and
            Isaiah, the great Egyptian ascetic—while dwelling in Palestine, these two were highly
            praised by all Christians—the first to experience such stories was Anastasius from
            Edessa, whom I have mentioned above as worthy of admiration and writing about.
            [Anastasius] saw, in a dream, the great Peter, the high priest of our Lord Jesus Christ,
            who is also called the Prince of apostles, commanding him to come quickly, riding a
            so-called post-horse (βέρηδος). When he woke up, he told me about the vision and the
            order, and even added a description of his priestly face. When I then concluded, [84]
            from what was told, that what he had seen was not a dream but a divine revelation which,
            through this holy man, called the worthy Anastasius to monastic life, I said: “You have
            actually seen the great man, and you should obey at once! For this is the meaning of the
            revelation.” He, however, since he had an uncle who at the time was governing the
            province, said: “I am afraid to travel by land, and would prefer to wait for a northerly
            wind and go to Palestine by sea. ” Since, because of this, he was delayed for some days
            without getting what he waited for, and was becoming worried, I reminded him of the
            vision he had seen which urged him to hurry by land to the highly honoured high priest
            and servant of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. And since, because of his
            uncle, he was afraid to pass through [Tyre] when coming from Beirut, I advised him not
            to pass through Tyre, where he [the uncle] was living at the time, at day-time, but to
            pause outside the city and then, in the middle of the night, pass through Tyre. He took
            this advice and acted accordingly, and eventually came to <placeName>Caesarea in
               Palestine</placeName>. And so God, who had called him by means of this holy man,
            arranged that he met some pupils of the great Peter [85] and learnt from them where he
            was living, so that he could go to him. When he was talking with them they said: “You
            were ordered to come quickly. Why are you so late?” And later, when he had joined him,
            and experienced the virtues of this divine man, and listened to the stories about [him],
            and had promised God monastic life, and become his subject, his body was immediately
            free from the leprosy, called the sacred disease, that was already beginning to get hold
            of him. When this became known to the worthy Elishaʿ in Beirut, it made him want to go,
            too—for the God-loving Evagrius’ had exalted the monastic life many times, expecting to
            capture us all, or most of us. Being simple in his manners, the great Elishaʿ was not
            delayed like this. He, too, had long ago been granted a revelation of the holy man, who
            ordered him to rise in the night and sing the fiftieth psalm to God. Eventually, then,
            strong love lit the fire of divine philosophy in him—as he revealed to me, for I was
            staying with him at the time—so that he, unable to endure the flame of the divine call,
            hurried to [86] Palestine, to the holy man, and became his subordinate, having accepted
            the yoke of philosophy.<ab type="source" source="#bib513-2"/>
